# intendsort
This is a userscript to add a sort button to intend.do draft intentions - it just sorts your draft intentions numerically by goal number.
I created it because sorting them like this before I commit for the day helps me see imbalances of intentions on goals.

# Installation
You need the .js from this repo and a userscript manager like TamperMonkey. I use this in chrome and ARC but don't think there's any reason it wouldn't work in other browsers - if you encounter an issue with it let me know and I'll see what I can do to improve it.
